A Telegram bot for tracking COVID-19 cases in India based on the api made available by https://www.covid19india.org/.

This is a support version for maintainers of the website.

Technology Used : Python , Telegram API , Data Analysis

Feature of the Bot : 
1.Receive Notification instantly live updated for every 2 min in any telegram group about vaccination center by sending your DISTRICT ID and DATE.
2.Check out the graph of recent trends of COVID from 2020 - 2021.

Challenges yet to be solved :

1: Covid Bot is sending notification for every 2 min of particular district on a particluar date. 
Need to optimize the bot in such a way that it loop stop as soon as someone in the group send command "Stop".
